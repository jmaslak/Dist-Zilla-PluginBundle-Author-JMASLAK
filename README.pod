Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::JMASLAK - JMASLAK's Plugin Bundle

=head1 VERSION

version 0.005

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is Joelle Maslak's plugin bundle, used for her modules.  If you're not
her, you probably want to create your own plugin module because I may modify
this module based on her needs, breaking third party modules that use this.

All of the following are in this module as of v0.003.

It is somewhat equivilent to:

    [NextRelease]
    [AutoPrereqs]
    [ConfirmRelease]
    [ContributorCovenant]

    copy = 'README.pod'

    [Git::Check]
    allow_dirty = dist.ini
    allow_dirty = Changes
    allow_dirty = README.pod

    [Git::Commit]
    allow_dirty = dist.ini
    allow_dirty = Changes
    allow_dirty = README.pod

    [Git::Push]
    [Git::Tag]

This creates a C<CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md> from the awesome Contributor Covenant
project, a C<Changes> file, a C<CONTRIBUTING> file, a C<TODO> file,
a C<MANIFEST_SKIP> file, an C<AUTHOR_PLEDGE> file that indicates CPAN admins
can take ownership should the project become abandoned, and a C<.travis.yml>
file that will probably need to be edited.  If these files exist already, they
will not get overwritten.

It also generates a C<.mailmap> base file suitable for Joelle, if one does
not already exists.

=head1 USAGE

In your C<dist.ini> -

    [@Filter]
    -bundle  = @Author::JMASLAK
    -version = 0.003

The C<-version> option should specify the latest version required and tested
with a given package.
